# Image Search Tool with Pexels API

This repository is home to an innovative image search application that leverages the Pexels API to fetch and display images based on user descriptions. The tool is built with JavaScript and utilizes the `fetch` API to communicate with Pexels, providing a seamless and responsive user experience.

## Features

- **Intuitive Search**: Users can search for images by entering descriptive keywords.
- **Rich Image Gallery**: Displays a gallery of high-quality images sourced from Pexels.
- **Responsive Layout**: Ensures a great viewing experience across all devices.
- **API Integration**: Efficiently uses the Pexels API to fetch relevant images.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and clean UI design for easy navigation.
- **Dynamic Content**: The gallery updates dynamically based on the search query.

## How It Works

The application sends a request to the Pexels API with the user's search description. It then processes the response and displays the images in a grid layout. JavaScript's `fetch` method is used for asynchronous API calls, making the search process quick and efficient.
